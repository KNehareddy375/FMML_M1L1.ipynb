There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "Yes, averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits (e.g., through cross-validation) tends to give more consistent results. This is because it reduces the variability caused by the randomness of any single train-validation split. By training and validating on different subsets of the data, the estimate becomes less dependent on a particular partitioning, thereby providing a more reliable measure of the model's performance.\n",
